# Stroke Prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) strokes are the second leading cause of death around the world. In this notebook I will attempt to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on a myriad of factors

## Features
- id: unique identifier
- gender: "Male", "Female", "Other"
- age: patients age
- hypertension: 0 for no, 1 for yes
- heart_disease: 0 for no, 1 for yes
- ever_married: "No", "Yes"
- work_type: "Children", "Govt_job", "Never_Worked", "Private", "Self-Employed"
- residence type: "Rural", "Urban"
- Avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in blood
- BMI: Patients Body Mass Index
- smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", "unknown"
- stroke: 0 for no, 1 for yes

It is important to note that for smoking_status of "unknown" there was no information collected on the patient

This data set was downloaded from Kaggle.com. I want to thank the kaggle users who helped me get stuck when applying the classification algorithms.
