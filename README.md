# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio! 
This portfolio is comprised of many different projects covering a wide range of data science and data analysis topics. Topics will include
 - Clustering Techniques and Algorithms
 - Decision Tree Techniques and Algorithms
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Regression Modeling

Projects will vary in length and each one will have a README file associated with it. The README file is there to give an insight into the 
dataset and details on what each project covered. The data sets in use will come from Kaggle.com, r/datasets, and data.gov among other sites.
I hope you find these projects interesting and take some analytical insight with you.
